# React Components :sparkles:

Components are part of what makes React so versatile. They are reusable, self contained pieces of code and are considered the building blocks of React applications. In these past few projects at Holberton, we have been using functional components. This project will be focusing on converting our functional components to class components, and knowing when to use the different types of components.

## Learning Objectives:

- When to use a Class or a function to create a component
- The lifecycle of a Class component
- How to test a component
- How to utilize a Jest spy to verify that a function is being called correctly
- What an HOC is and how to use it
- How to optimize performance and control which components to render

## Requirements:
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `node 12.x.x` and `npm 6.x.x`
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md file`, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
