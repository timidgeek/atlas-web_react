# React Redux action creator+normalizr :sparkles:

Normalizr is a utility library for restructuring nested JSON objects into a normalized form. It simplifies the shape of your data, making it easier to manage, update, and store in your application's state.

Redux is a state management library commonly used with React (though it can be used with any JavaScript framework or library). It provides a predictable state container that helps manage the state of an application in a single immutable store.

When used together, they can provide a powerful way to manage state and handle complex data structures in your application.
