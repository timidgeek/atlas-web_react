# Webpack :sparkles:

At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. Webpack takes your website's files, figures out which pieces you need, and puts them together in the right order. It helps make your website fast by combining all the pieces in the most efficient way possible. Also, it can do extra things like making the pieces smaller so your website loads quicker. Basically, webpack is a handy tool that helps developers organize and optimize their code.
